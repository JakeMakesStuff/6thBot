Thanks for joining the **Official r/6thform Discord Server**!

Once you're all set up, here's what you can do:

:key: **1. Join a Year**
This gives you access to all general channels. We have 4 ranks for this:
:small_blue_diamond: Pre Sixth Form
:small_blue_diamond: Year 12
:small_blue_diamond: Year 13
:small_blue_diamond: Post Sixth Form
To join one of these, go to `#years` and react to the message with your chosen year.

:game_die: **2. Join Optional Channels**
After joining a year, go to `#optional`. Feel free to join any role that applies to you!

:books: **3. Add Subject Roles**
Finally, go to `#bot-commands` and type **!subjects** to see our full subject list.
:small_orange_diamond: You can add subjects by typing **?rank [subject]** (such as '?rank PE').
Then, you'll be able to talk in channels where people share the same subjects as you.

Most importantly of all, make sure to have a good time!
